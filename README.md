# VSCode Setup

> Personal setup for VSCode.

In this repo you can find my VSCode settings, extensions, and a script to install the extensions from the list you get with `code --list-extensions`.

## How to run the script

`./vscode-ext-install.sh` vscode.extensions

That's it!

## How to copy the settings

Just copy the JSON content into VSCode settings.
