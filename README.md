## Visual Studio Code

In this repo you can find my VSCode settings, extensions, and a script to install the extensions from the list you get with `code --list-extensions`.

### How to run the script

`./vscode-ext-install.sh vscode.extensions`

**You need the `code` command to be available in the terminal.**
That's it!

### How to copy the settings

Just copy the JSON content into VSCode settings.
